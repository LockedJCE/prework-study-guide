# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to give myself a strong foundation to begin my journey of becoming a full stack web developer and to start off on a good note with a good reference point for the course going forward. This will help answer some of my basic questions and give me a solid lookback point while I continue building my base of knowledge in the course. I learned some of the basic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it's bettered my scope of knowledge pertaining to building a website.

## Installation

I built the website through making multiple versions and using GitHub to track my progress and limit the amount of work it took to fix a mistake. I began with HTML, and moved to CSS, then finally JavaScript. It took many steps of iterating more and more code so i could get the hang of it but in the end it came together great.

## Usage

This is a great study guide to see general notes on each of the building blocks of the site. I also added a way for the site to choose what you study first,  open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first. Each time you refresh the site, it will have a different topic listed under the "Which topic should we study first?" message.
